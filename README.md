# Advent-of-Code
This repo contains my personal answers for Advent of Code written mostly in Python because I wanted to challenge myself. This could be subject to change but as of 2023 it's mostly Python. It does use a [template] (https://github.com/AlexeSimon/adventofcode) from another user by the name of Alexe Simon 

# Running the Code
All of the files can be run from their directory in terminal to test my answers. As stated by Alexe Simon in his repo as well, the names for code.py and input.txt are hardcoded and should not be renamed.
